# GreenPool
Our goal is to provide urban areas of Paris with an innovative service that connects recycling with community involvement, encouraging consumers to clean their surrounding by bringing personal or randomly collected waste to specific bins that are capable of identifying and weighing the waste and associating the quantity submitted with our “eco point reward system”.
